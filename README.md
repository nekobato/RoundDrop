# CommandCircle

CommandCircle is a Desktop Application Launcher for macOS that allows you to run commands and applications from a circular menu. It is inspired by the 聖剣伝説 2 (Seiken Densetsu 2) command menu.

## Usage

After launching CommandCircle, the launcher can be displayed by default using the Control+Option+Z keyboard shortcut.

## Since Mac has the Dock, isn't this app unnecessary?

Yes, that's right.
